## AutoSmelt
<b>Usage:</b>
``/autosmelt``

<b>Description:</b>
Using this command instantly smelts <i>all</i> <b>iron and gold ores</b> from your inventory. However, you will also need to have all of the <b>necessary <i>fuel</i></b> (such as coal blocks, coal, and charcoal) <b><i> in your inventory</i></b> to successfully use this command. The game will notify you if you do not have enough fuel.

<b>Disclaimer: </b>
This command greedily prioritizes coal blocks over coal / charcoal and will not give any change back.  
In other words, if you have coal blocks in your inventory and you use `/autosmelt` to smelt a single iron ore,  
it will consume that coal block to do so, and you will not get your 8 coal pieces back.

A small price to pay for automation.

## Bible
<b>Usage:</b>
``` /bible <translation> <book> <chapter> <start> <end> ```

<b>Description:</b>
This command fetches passages or entire chapters of the Bible (that <b> you </b> want to read) from the Internet, and compiles all of it down into a <i>written book</i> for you to read in Minecraft.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 - `translation` - The translation of the Bible you want your passages to be in.
 - `book` - The book of the Bible you want to read. 
 - `chapter` - The chapter of the book.
 - `start` - The verse you want to start at (<i>optional</i>). 
 - `end` - The verse you want to end at (<i>optional</i>).

<b> Supported Translations:</b>
Due to many variations of the Bible being protected by copyright, this command only has access to the following versions of the Bible, which are:

> <b>KJV</b> (King James Version) \
> <b>FBVNTPsalms</b> (Free Bible Version New Testament with Psalms)\
> <b>ESV</b> (English Standard Version)\
> <b>WEB</b> (World English Bible [Protestant])\
> <b>T4T</b> (Translation for Translators)\
> <b>ASV</b> (The Holy Bible, American Standard Version)\
> <b>RV</b> (Revised Version)\
> <b>GNV</b> (Geneva Bible)

Simply add any of these <i>abbreviated translation names</i> in the first parameter of the command to get verses for that translation.

<b>Abbreviations:</b>
Instead of typing out the entire chapter by its full name, you can use book abbreviations to make your life easier while using this command. For instance, ``ezekiel`` can be abbreviated to ``ezk``, ``colossians`` can be abbreviated to ``col``, ``mark`` can be abbreviated to ``mrk``, ``galatians`` can be abbreviated to ``gal``, and many more.

<b>Usage Examples:</b>  
`/bible ESV romans 12` gives you the <i>entire chapter</i> of Romans 12 in ESV format.\
`/bible KJV mrk 1 7` gives you Mark 1:7-45 (end of chapter) in KJV format.\
`/bible KJV gal 6 2 3` gives you Galatians 6:2-3 in KJV format.\
`/bible WEB romans 6 2 2` gives you Romans 6:2 in WEB format.

<b> AutoCorrect:</b>
With the help of tries, this command utilizes a very aggressive autocorrect. This means that misspelling books such as ``ezekiel`` will, in most cases, give you what you desire.

For example, typing ``/bible ESV eziekiel 1`` will give you the book of ``ezekiel`` in ESV format, even though you spelled ``ezekiel`` wrong.

## Clear Bibles
<b>Usage:</b>
``/clearbibles``

<b>Description:</b>
This command removes all written books generated by the ``/bible`` command from your inventory.

## Clear Junk
<b>Usage:</b>
``/clearjunk [list of filters]``

<b>Description: </b>
Ever have an epic mining adventure, only to find out that you are running out of inventory space? In most cases, this is due to junk items cluttering up your inventory, which can be both of a nuisance and frustrating to deal with on a daily basis. This command aveliates that pain by <i><b>completely removing junk items from your inventory</b></i>, so you will always have room for your precious ores and diamonds.

<b> Filters: </b>
You might notice that you can append a list of ``filters`` into this command. This is because this command defines many different categories of junk found in Minecraft. However, there are certain times where these junk items have actual use and you do not want to accidentally destroy them. As a result, these filters are available for you to <b>tell the command what <i>you</i> want to remove and not remove.</b>

The items that falls under each category are as follows:

|Common|Stone|Natural|Armor|Brewing|Weapons|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Rotten Flesh | Cobblestone |Dirt|All Leather Armor*|Spider Eyes| Golden Sword* |
| Bones | Stone | Sand | All Chainmail Armor* | Bows* |
| String | Granite | Gravel | All Gold Armor* |
| Seeds (wheat) | Diorite
| | Andesite |

* Armor and weapons must be <b>unenchanted</b> and <b>damaged</b> in order for this command to remove them. This is to prevent your own gear from being removed accidentally.

If you want to remove <b>all of the items</b> listed above in your inventory, you can simply use ``/clearjunk all`` to do so. This list will be continuously updated in the near future.


<b>Usage Examples:</b>  
``/clearjunk stone`` removes all listed stone variants from your inventory.\
``/clearjunk stone natural`` removes all listed stone variants and natural blocks from your inventory.\
``/clearjunk armor common brewing stone`` removes all listed leather, chainmail, and gold armor, common mob drops, spider eyes, and stone variants from your inventory.\
``/clearjunk`` without any parameters automatically defaults to ``/clearjunk common``, which removes all common mob drops from your inventory.

## Get Coordinates
<b> Usage: </b>
``/getcoordinates <player>``

<b>Description:</b>
Outputs the <x,y,z> coordinates of any currently online player in this server. This command fails to work on players that are not in the same dimension as you.

Using this command without a username will print out your own coordinates instead.

<b>Usage Examples:</b>  
``/getcoordinates CompleteEdd`` prints the coordinates of user ``CompleteEdd``, which is me, to your chat.\
``/getcoordinates`` prints your own coordinates to your chat.
